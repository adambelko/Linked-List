Single-linked list

This is a single-linked list as an alternative to an array. The list is composed of nodes, each node contains the data and a reference
to the next node (link/pointer). The first node is called <b>head</b> of the list, and the last node is called <b>tail</b> with
reference to null.

Linked list functions :

-   Append a new node to the end of the list
-   Prepend a new node to the start of the list
-   Returns the total number of nodes in the list
-   Returns the first node in the list
-   Returns the last node of the list
-   Check if a value exists and returns boolean value
-   Returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found
-   Represent LinkedList objects (nodes) as strings
